### Welcome to my GitHub profile, stranger

You may notice that I'm not active here anymore or don't host personal projects or like that.

The reason behind this is that I don't really want to use GitHub anymore. GitHub for me is now a purely a tool to contribute projects I like rather than make my own.

I'm migrated to selfhosted Gitea at https://git.mentality.rip/a1batross.

If you want to ask me some questions, I'm reachable at:
